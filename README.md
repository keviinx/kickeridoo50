## About Kickeridoo50

The name **Kickeridoo** came to be by fusing the word **Kicker** which is the German nickname of *foosball* and Didger**idoo** *(No idea how we came up with that name)*. Me and my colleague loves to play foosball during our break time and to keep track of the scores, I have been using *Microsoft Excel* spreadsheet.

So then I had the idea of making a web application so that updating the score of the player will be easier. The application is called **Kickeridoo50**.
